                Meetings Where and When?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Lodge meets at The Freemasons Hall, Welbeck Road, West Bridgford
                NG2 7QW. There are 7 regular Lodge meetings, each year, which are held
                on the first Tuesday of the month from October to April.
                <br>
                Each one consists of a formal masonic meeting with various degree
                ceremonies and lectures, as well as normal Lodge business.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is expected that Members will attend all regular meetings of the Lodge,
                unless prevented by illness, family matters or unavoidable business. The
                Lodge actively supports every member in his progress through the Offices
                of the Lodge. This is achieved by the help of an active Instruction Circle,
                which meets on the second Tuesday in October to March (excluding
                December) and a Rehearsal on the Tuesday before each Lodge Meeting.
              </p>

                Social
              </h3>
              <p>
                Every meeting is followed by a Festive Board (dinner), usually two
                courses. This is a social gathering around a formal meal, which is
                always extremely convivial.
                <br>
                West Bridgford Masonic Hall has its own dedicated bar, where other
                drinks including tea and coffee are always available. We are always
                delighted to welcome visiting Brethren, who we trust will find us a
                friendly and hospitable Lodge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditionally, two formal social evenings are held each year; the first
                being a Christmas Dinner, which follows the Lodge Meeting on the first
                Tuesday in December and the second a Ladies Festival, usually held on
                the second Saturday in April. Masonic and Non-masonic friends and
                family are all invited to both these events.
                <br>
                Other informal social gatherings are arranged on a less regular basis.

                Charity
              </h3>
              <p>
                Individual members make regular contributions, within their means,
                to masonic and non-masonic charities, both locally and nationally.
                <br>
                This is partly achieved by a raffle held at each Festive Board.
